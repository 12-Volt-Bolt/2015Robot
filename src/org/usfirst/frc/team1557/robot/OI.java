	// // CREATING BUTTONS
	// One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a
	// joystick.
	// You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
	// number it is.
	// Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
	// Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);

	// There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
	// by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
	// commands the same as any other Button.

	// // TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
	// Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
	// three ways:

	// Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
	// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	// button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

	// Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
	// the button is released.
	// button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

	// Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
	// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	// button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
